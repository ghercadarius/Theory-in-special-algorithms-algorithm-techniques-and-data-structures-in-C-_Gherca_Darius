Theory in special algorithms, algorithm techniques and data structures in C++.

(Work in progress)

It provides theory in algorithms, algorithm techniques and data structures in C++, but also problems with solutions and solution descriptions.

First build is in Romanian. Future proof will provide english translation.

Made 2 python project to aid in the translation of the main.cpp:

The first python helper is made to select the comments and shown text and extract them in a seperate file for them to be translated and be inserted  back in the cpp file

The second python helper was made to replace "\n" with endl in the whole cpp file in order to avoid conflicts between shown strings and the new line.
